You can customise your O bag to reflect your own style and use it however you want. There are thousands of different combinations for you to enjoy. Composing your O bag is really easy and fun. If you need help, you can consult our assembly handbook which is available online. We recommend that you avoid exposing the O bag body to the sun's rays for extended periods of time, to high temperatures (for instance, do not leave it next to a hot radiator in winter and don’t forget it inside a hot car in summer) or to other heat sources so that it does not become damaged or change shape or colour. Cleaning the O bag body is incredibly simple - just use the O clean sponge or lukewarm water (30°C) with neutral soap, taking care not to rub. The image is merely indicative.
